## RMarkdown = R + Markdown

1. It combines the the magic of R with the simplicity of Markdown documents
1. The purpose: write your manuscripts and automatically insert results!
1. Use cases:
  * prevent rounding errors
  * promote computational reproducibility
  * encourage error correction by minimizing manual work
  
## Learning goals

By the end of this class you should:

* Know what Markdown is and how the syntax works, 
* See how to integrate code and data in RMarkdown, 
* Understand the different output formats from RMarkdown and how to generate them
* Know about generating APA format files with [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) and bibtex.

## The Markdown

- Markdown is the simplest markup language around!
- Open standard, convertable into `.tex`, `.docx`, `.html`, `.pdf`, etc
- You can [learn Markdown in five (!) minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/)
- Despite being simple, very powerful and used on many web platforms

## Basic Markdown: headings

- `# Header 1` creates a heading of the first level
- `## Header 2` creates a heading of the _second_ level
- `### Header 3` ...
- etc

## Basic Markdown: letter styles

- `__bold__` creates __bold__
- `_italic_` creates _italic_
- `***bold and italic!***` creates ***bold and italic!***

## The R

- If you're here, you probably know R
- Programming language for statistics
- Packages to add functionality
- Everything open-source!

## Combining R and Rmarkdown

- This presentation also written in Rmarkdown!
- We can include both code and its outputs, or just one of the two
- Great not only for manuscripts, but also for course notes :-)
