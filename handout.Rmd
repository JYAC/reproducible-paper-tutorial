There is also a slidedeck that goes along with this [here](https://libscie.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop), which is worth looking at if you don't know what you're doing on this page and what to look at. Going through this document takes approximately 90 minutes, assuming you already know some basic `R` programming.

# Introduction

This document is a short tutorial on using RMarkdown to mix prose and code together for creating reproducible scientific documents. It's based on documents that both Chris and Mike wrote about  independently (see [here](https://elifesciences.org/labs/cad57bcf/composing-reproducible-manuscripts-using-r-markdown) and [here](http://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/11/preventing-statistical-reporting-errors.html) if you're interested). In short: RMarkdown allows you to create documents that are compiled with code, producing your next scientific paper.^[Note: this is also possible for Python and other open-source data analysis languages, but we focus on R]

Now we're together trying to help spread the word, because it can make writing manuscripts so much easier! We wrote this handout in RMarkdown as well (looks really sweet, no?).

## Who is this aimed at?

We aim this document at anyone writing manuscripts and using R, including those who...

1. ...collaborate with people who use Word
2. ...want to write complex equations
3. ...want to be able to change bibliography styles with less hassle
4. ...want to spend more time actually doing research!

## Why write reproducible papers?

Cool, thanks for sticking with us and reading up through here!

There are three reasons to write reproducible papers. To be right, to be reproducible, and to be efficient. There are more, but these are convincing to us. In more depth:

1. to avoid errors. Using an automated method for scraping APA-formatted stats out of PDFs, @nuijten2015 found that over 10% of p-values in published papers were inconsistent with the reported details of the statistical test, and 1.6% were what they called "grossly" inconsistent, e.g. difference between the p-value and the test statistic meant that one implied statistical significance and the other did not. Nearly half of all papers had errors in them. 

2. to promote computational reproducibility. Computational reproducibility means that other people can take your data and get the same numbers that are in your paper. Even if you don't have errors, it can still be very hard to recover the numbers from published papers because of ambiguities in analysis. Creating a document that literally specifies where all the numbers come from in terms of code that operates over the data removes all this ambiguity.

3. to create spiffy documents that can be revised easily. This is actually a really big neglected one for us. At least one of us used to tweak tables and figures by hand constantly, leading to a major incentive *never to rerun analyses* because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustratoring all the numbers and figures in a paper. That's a bad thing! It means you have an incentive to be lazy and to avoid redoing your stuff. And you waste tons of time when you do. In contrast, with a reproducible document, you can just rerun with a tweak to the code. You can even specify what you want the figures and tables to look like before you're done with all the data collection (e.g., for purposes of preregistraion or a registered report). 

## Learning goals

By the end of this class you should:

* Know what Markdown is and how the syntax works, 
* See how to integrate code and data in RMarkdown, 
* Understand the different output formats from RMarkdown and how to generate them, and
* Know about generating APA format files with `papaja` and bibtex.

# Installation

Before we get started with running everything, make sure to have `R` installed (download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)) and `Rstudio` (download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)). If you haven't yet, go do that first and we'll be here when you get back!

# Getting started

Great, you installed both `R` and `Rstudio`. Next up, making your first RMarkdown file.

Fire up Rstudio and create a new RMarkdown file. Don't worry about the settings, we'll get to that later.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/newfile.png')
```

If you click on "Knit" (or hit `CTRL+SHIFT+K`) the RMarkdown file will run and generate all results and present you with a PDF file, HTML file, or a Word file. If RStudio requests you to install packages, click yes and see whether everything works to begin with. We need that before we get going!

# Structure of an RMarkdown file

An RMarkdown file contains several parts. Most essential are the header, the body text, and code chunks.

## The file

### Header

Headers in RMarkdown files, contain some metadata about your document, which you can customize to your liking. Below is a simple example that purely states the title, author name(s), date^[Pro-tip: you can use the `Sys.Date()` function to have that use the current date when creating the document.], and output format.

```yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "NAME"
date: "July 28, 2017"
output: html_document
---
```

For now, go ahead and set `html_document` to `word_document`, except if you have strong preferences for `HTML` or `PDF`^[Note: to create PDF documents you also need a TeX installation. Don't know what that is? You probably don't have it then.]

### Body text

The body of the document is where you actually write your reports. This is primarily written in the Markdown format, which is explained in the [Markdown syntax](#markdown-syntax) section.

The beauty of RMarkdown is, however, that you can evaluate `R` code right in the text. To do this, you start inline code with \`r, type the code you want to run, and close it again with a \`. Usually, this key is below the escape (`ESC`) key  or next to the left SHIFT button.

For example, if you want to have the result of 48 times 35 in your text, you type \` r 48-35\`, which returns `r 48 - 35`. Please note that if you return a value with many decimals, it will also print these depending on your settings (for example, `r pi`).

### Code chunks

In the section above we introduced you to running code inside text, but often you need to take several steps in order to get to the result you need. And you don't want to do data cleaning in the text! This is why there are code chunks. A simple example is a code chunk loading packages

## Markdown syntax

From [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html](), see also [this cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

The idea of markdown is that it's really really easy to read and write:

* It's easy to get `*italic*` or `**bold**`. 
* You can get headings using `# heading1` for first level, `## heading2` for second-level, and `### heading3` for third level. 
* Lists are delimited with `*` for each entry.
* You can write links by writing `[here's my link](http://foo.com)`.

And then you can insert code by using the code chunk environment `\`\`\`\`, and its outputs will get mixed in. 

# Code and prose, mixed together

First load packages, I always put these together at the top. 

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
library(devtools)
```

Now, here are some of the startup options I often use. Caching can be very helpful for large files, but can also cause problems when there are external dependencies that change. 

```{r}
opts_chunk$set(fig.width=8, fig.height=5, 
echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE)
```

And you can use various local and glbal chunk options like `echo=FALSE` to suppress showing the code (better for papers). 

## Graphs

It's really easy to include graphs, like this one.

```{r}
qplot(hp, mpg, col = factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
```

External graphics can also be included.

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/file")
```


## Statistics

It's also really easy to include statistical tests of various types. 

For this I really like the `broom` package, which formats the outputs of various tests really nicely. Paired with knitr's `kable` you can make very simple tables. 

```{r}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
kable(tidy(mod), digits = 3)
```

Of course, cleaning these up can take some work. For example, we'd need to rename a bunch of fields to make this table have the labels we wanted (e.g., to turn `hp` into `Horsepower`). 

I also do a lot of APA-formatted statistics. We can compute them first, and then print them inline.

```{r}
ts <- with(mtcars,t.test(hp[cyl==4], hp[cyl==6]))
```

There's a statistically-significant difference in horsepower for 4- and 6-cylinder cars  ($t(`r  round(ts$parameter,2)`) = `r  round(ts$statistic,2)`$, $p = `r round(ts$p.value,3)`$). To insert these stats inline I wrote e.g. `round(ts$parameter, 2)` inside an inline code block. <!-- APA would require omission of the leading zero. papaja::printp() will let you do that and it also addresses the next point but I don't know whether you want to include that function here. -->

Note that rounding can get you in trouble here, because it's very easy to have an output of $p = 0$ when in fact $p$ can never be exactly equal to 0. 

# Putting it all to use!


# Writing APA-format papers

## Using the `papaja` package

`papaja` is a R-package including a R Markdown template that can be used to produce documents that adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition).

### Software requirements

To use `papaja` make sure you are using the latest versions of R and RStudio. If you want to create PDF- in addition to DOCX-files you need **[TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) 2013 or later**. Try [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux. Some Linux users may need a few additional TeX packages for the LaTeX document class `apa6` to work:
    
```{sh ubuntu_extras, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-publishers texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra texlive-humanities lmodern
```

### Installing `papaja`

`papaja` has not yet been released on CRAN but you can install it from GitHub.

```{r install_papapja, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools package if necessary
if(!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("devtools")

# Install papaja
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
```

### Creating a document

The APA manuscript template should now be available through the RStudio menus when creating a new R Markdown file.

```{r template-selection, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "papaja's APA6 template is available through the RStudio menues."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/images/template_selection.png")
```

When you click RStudio's *Knit* button `papaja`, `rmarkdown,` and `knitr` work together to create an APA conform manuscript that includes both your manuscript text and the results of any embedded R code.

```{r knit-button, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The *Knit* button in the RStudio."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/images/knitting.png")
```

Note, if you don't have TeX installed on your computer, or if you would like to create a Word document replace `output: papaja::apa6_pdf` with `output: papaja::apa6_word` in the document YAML header.

`papaja` provides some rendering options that only work if you use `output: papaja::apa6_pdf`.
`figsintext` indicates whether figures and tables should be included at the end of the document---as required by APA guidelines---or rendered in the body of the document.
If `figurelist`, `tablelist`, or `footnotelist` are set to `yes` a list of figure captions, table captions, or footnotes is given following the reference section.
`lineno` indicates whether lines should be continuously numbered through out the manuscript.


### Report statistical analyses
`apa_print()` facilitates reporting of statistical analyses.
The function formats the contents of R objects and produces readily reportable text.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
recall_anova <- afex::aov_car(
  Recall ~ (Task * Valence * Dosage) + Error(Subject/(Task * Valence)) + Dosage
  , data = mixed_data
  , type = 3
)
recall_anova_results <- apa_print(recall_anova, es = "pes")
recall_anova_results_p <- apa_print(recall_anova, es = "pes", in_paren = TRUE)
```

Now, you can report the results of your analyses like so:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
Item valence (`r anova_results_p$full$Valence`) and the task affected recall
performance, `r anova_results$full$Task`; the dosage, however, had no effect
on recall, `r anova_results$full$Dosage`. There was no significant interaction.
```

<!--
> Item valence (`r #recall_anova_results_p$full$Valence`) and the task affected recall performance, `r #recall_anova_results$full$Task`;
> the dosage, however, had no effect on recall, `r #recall_anova_results$full$Dosage`.
> There was no significant interaction.
-->

`apa_print()` also creates reportable tables---in this case a complete ANOVA table.
You can include the table into the document by passing `recall_anova_results$table` to `apa_table()`.
Remeber to include the `results = "asis"` argument in the chunk options of the chunk that generates the table.

```{r results = "asis", echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apa_table(
  recall_anova_results$table
  , align = c("lrcrrr")
  , caption = "ANOVA table for the analyis of the example data set."
  , note = "This is a table created using R and papaja."
)
```


### Cross-referencing

`papaja` enables the use of `bookdown` cross-referencing syntax as detailed in the [bookdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html).
Generally, a cross-reference to a figure, table, or document section can be done by using the syntax `\@ref(label)`.
If you set a figure caption in a code chunk via the chunk option `fig.cap = "This is my figure caption."`, the label for that figure is based on the label of the code chunk, e.g., if the chunk label is `foo`, the figure label will be `fig:foo`.
If you used `knitr::kable()` or `apa_table()` to create a table, the label for that table is, again, based on the label of the code chunk, e.g., if the chunk label is `foo`, the figure label will be `tab:foo`.


## Bibiographic management

It's also possible to include references using `bibtex`, by using `@ref` syntax. I like [bibdesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) as a simple reference manager that integrates with google scholar, but many other options are possible. 

With a bibtex file included, you can refer to papers like @nuijten2016 in text, or cite them parenthetically [e.g., @nuijten2016].

So in conclusion, and as described by @xie2013, `knitr` is really amazing!


`citr` is an R package that provides an easy-to-use [RStudio addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) that facilitates inserting citations.
The addin will automatically look up the Bib(La)TeX-file(s) specified in the YAML front matter.
The references for the inserted citations are automatically added to the documents reference section.

```{r citr-gif, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Demonstration of the RStudio addin from the `citr` package that inserts R Markdown citations."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/citr/master/tools/images/addin_demo.gif")
```

Once `citr` is installed (`install.packages("citr")`) and you have restarted your R session, the addin appears in the menus and you can define a [keyboard shortcut](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/#keyboard-shorcuts) to call the addin.





## Computational reproducibility concerns

`packrat` for package versioning <!-- Given that there's not a lot of time to go into the details of package management, maybe recommending the `checkpoint` package is the better option? -->

or include `session_info` from `devtools` at least. 

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
```

could even use `docker`, but that's outside the scope of the course!
